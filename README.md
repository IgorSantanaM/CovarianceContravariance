# C# Covariance and Contravariance Example

This repository contains a demonstration of covariance and contravariance concepts in C#. It showcases how these advanced features can be utilized with interfaces, generics, and delegates to achieve more flexible and intuitive type relationships in your code.

## Overview

In this example, we explore a scenario involving animals and their sounds:

- **Interfaces:**
  - `IAnimal`: Base interface for all animals.
  - `IDog`: Derived interface for dogs, inheriting from `IAnimal`.
  - `ICat`: Derived interface for cats, inheriting from `IAnimal`.
  - `IAnimalSound<out T>`: Covariant interface for making animal sounds.
  - `IMakeSound<in T>`: Contravariant interface for performing animal sounds.

- **Classes:**
  - `Dog`: Implements `IDog` interface, representing a dog that can bark.
  - `Cat`: Implements `ICat` interface, representing a cat that can meow.
  - `AnimalSound<T>`: Implements `IAnimalSound<out T>`, demonstrating covariance.
  - `SoundPerformer<T>`: Implements `IMakeSound<in T>`, demonstrating contravariance.

- **Usage Example:**
  - Shows how covariance allows using more derived types (`IDog` and `ICat`) where a base type (`IAnimal`) is expected.
  - Demonstrates contravariance by allowing more derived types (`IDog` and `ICat`) to be passed where a base type (`IAnimal`) is expected.
